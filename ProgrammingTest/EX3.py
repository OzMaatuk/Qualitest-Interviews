# Given the code:

import math

def readAllLines(path):
    return []

def func(path: str):
    num=0
    for i in readAllLines(path):
        num+=i.split('\\s+').count()
    return math.sqrt(readAllLines(path).count()*num)

# The code should read lines from file, with specified path as the function input.
# The code will split each line by whitespaces, where '\\s+' indicates for matches sequence of one or more whitespace characters.
# The code will count the number of elements after splitting the line
# (actually spliting each line to word, and counting number of words in each line)
# The code will return the power of number of lines in the file multiples the number of words in the file by two.
# ((num_of_lines * num_of_words)^2)
